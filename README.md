# Multi-Threaded-Java-Application
* This is a multi threaded java application created for a class assignment.
* The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a synchornized java application using threads and reentrant locks. 
* This project simulates a package warehouse that transports packages from an input conveyor and an output conveyor. 

# What I Learned 

* Developed an Object-Orented program in Java that uses thread lock synchronization using reentrant locks. 
* The process of executing threads and having them call for lock permistion to perform their task.
